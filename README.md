# 🚀 Software Engineering - The Work Experience Edition 🚀

## Introduction 📜

Welcome to our Software Engineering work experience tour! Today, we present you with a unique opportunity to gain 
valuable work experience in the vast field of software engineering and development. This project is designed to give
you a taste of what it's like to work as a software engineer, and hopefully inspire you to pursue a career in this
rewarding field.

The aim is to provide you with a sneak peek into what a typical day in the life of a software engineer looks like. 
You'll be interacting with our expert team of developers, architects, designers, and project managers, understanding 
their roles and responsibilities, and experiencing firsthand how they work together to bring concepts to life.

Not only will you get to learn about the different technologies, tools, and methodologies used in the software 
development life cycle, but you will also understand the value of problem-solving techniques, teamwork, communication, 
and time management skills that are crucial for success in this field.

Throughout the day, you will be encouraged to ask questions, engage in discussions, and even work on mini-tasks that 
mirror real-world problems and projects. We want you to dive in, experience, learn, and, most importantly, 
enjoy the process.

Remember, software engineering is not just about writing code. It's about creating solutions, fostering innovation, 
and making a tangible impact on the world. Computer code is one of the many tools that we use to achieve this goal.  

## On The Agenda 📅

### Day 1 - The Basics & The Project 🔬

The day will be divided into two parts: the morning session and the afternoon session. The morning session will be
dedicated to learning about the different aspects of software engineering, while the afternoon session will be dedicated
to applying what you've learned in a mini-project that reflects a real-world scenario.

1. Onboarding - Laptop collection & Introduction to our team. (5 minutes)
2. Why We Do What We Do - Introduction to the company and our mission. (5 minutes)
3. How We Work - Agile, Scrum, Kanban, etc. (15 minutes)
4. The Software Development Life Cycle - From concept to production. (15 minutes)
5. The Tools of the Trade - IDEs, Git, Slack, etc. (15 minutes)
6. Research Break (Self-Learning Session) - A chance to review and reinforce what you've learned so far. (2 hours)
7. Lunch Break - A chance to relax, recharge and have lunch on us! (1 hour)
8. Project Kickoff - Introduction to the project and the problem statement. (15 minutes)
9. Dev-analysis Phase - Understanding the requirements and designing the solution. (1 hour)
10. Kick-off Ceremony - Presenting your analysis and proposed solution to the team. (10 minutes)
11. Implementation Phase - Working on the solution. (2 hours)
12. Sign-off ceremony - Presenting your solution to the team, and handing it over to the testers. (10 minutes)
13. The Wrap Up - Feedback, Q&A, and closing remarks. (15 minutes)

### Day 2 - Shadowing Our Team 👨‍💻

In the next day, you will get the opportunity to shadow our team of experts, learning about their roles and, 
most importantly, how they work together to bring concepts to life. You will be assigned a mentor who will guide you
throughout the day, answering any questions you may have and helping you understand the different aspects of software
engineering.
