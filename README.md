## Introduction 📜

Welcome to our Software Engineering work experience tour! Today, we present you with a unique opportunity to gain 
valuable work experience in the vast field of software engineering and development. This project is designed to give
you a taste of what it's like to work as a software engineer, and hopefully inspire you to pursue a career in this
rewarding field.

The aim is to provide you with a sneak peek into what a typical day in the life of a software engineer looks like. 
You'll be interacting with our expert team of developers, architects, designers, and project managers, understanding 
their roles and responsibilities, and experiencing firsthand how they work together to bring concepts to life.

Not only will you get to learn about the different technologies, tools, and methodologies used in the software 
development life cycle, but you will also understand the value of problem-solving techniques, teamwork, communication, 
and time management skills that are crucial for success in this field.

Throughout the day, you will be encouraged to ask questions, engage in discussions, and even work on mini-tasks that 
mirror real-world problems and projects. We want you to dive in, experience, learn, and, most importantly, 
enjoy the process.

Remember, software engineering is not just about writing code. It's about creating solutions, fostering innovation, 
and making a tangible impact on the world. Computer code is one of the many tools that we use to achieve this goal.  

## On The Agenda 📅

### Day 1 - The Basics & The Project 🔬

The day will be divided into two parts: the morning session and the afternoon session. The morning session will be
dedicated to learning about the different aspects of software engineering, while the afternoon session will be dedicated
to applying what you've learned in a mini-project that reflects a real-world scenario.

1. Onboarding - Laptop collection & Introduction to our team. (5 minutes)
2. Why We Do What We Do - Introduction to the company and our mission. (5 minutes)
3. How We Work - Agile, Scrum, Kanban, etc. (15 minutes)
4. The Software Development Life Cycle - From concept to production. (15 minutes)
5. The Tools of the Trade - IDEs, Git, Slack, etc. (15 minutes)
6. Research Break (Self-Learning Session) - A chance to review and reinforce what you've learned so far. (2 hours)
7. Lunch Break - A chance to relax, recharge and have lunch on us! (1 hour)
8. Project Kickoff - Introduction to the project and the problem statement. (15 minutes)
9. Dev-analysis Phase - Understanding the requirements and designing the solution. (1 hour)
10. Kick-off Ceremony - Presenting your analysis and proposed solution to the team. (10 minutes)
11. Implementation Phase - Working on the solution. (2 hours)
12. Sign-off ceremony - Presenting your solution to the team, and handing it over to the testers. (10 minutes)
13. The Wrap Up - Feedback, Q&A, and closing remarks. (15 minutes)

### Day 2 - Continue the Project as a Team Member 👨‍💻

In the next day, you will get the opportunity to participate in our stand-up meeting, shadow our team of experts, 
learning more about their roles and, most importantly, how they work together to bring concepts to life. You will be 
assigned a mentor who will guide you throughout the day, answering any questions you may have and helping you understand 
the different aspects of software engineering.

## Learning objectives 🎯

By participating in this 2-day immersive experience of software engineering, we aim to equip you with the following 
knowledge and skills:

- **Understanding the Role of a Software Engineer**: Get a hands-on understanding of the diverse roles and responsibilities
  that a software engineer undertakes, and how they fit within the broader tech industry.
- **Familiarity with Work Environment**: Gain familiarity with the professional environment in which software engineering 
  teams operate, including the software development life cycle, Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and other work methodologies.
- **Introduction to Essential Tools**: Get acquainted with the tools of the trade, including Integrated Development 
  Environments (IDEs), version control systems like Git, and programming languages like Kotlin.
- **Collaboration and Communication**: Understand the importance of teamwork, communication, and collaboration in 
  software development, and how cross-functional teams work together to deliver projects.
- **Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving**: Exercise critical thinking and problem-solving skills by participating in a
  mini-project, from understanding the requirements to designing and implementing the solution.
- **Project Management**: Learn about the different stages of a project, from kickoff to sign-off, and the practices 
  associated with each stage, such as presenting your analysis and proposed solution to the team.
- **Shadowing Professionals**: Gain insights from experienced professionals in the field by shadowing them, 
  understanding their daily tasks, challenges, and how they overcome them.
- **Career Exploration**: Explore the possibilities of a career in software engineering and gain insights to make 
  informed decisions about your future career path.

By the end of this tour, you will have a better understanding of the field of software engineering, the skills necessary
to succeed in it, and the value that software engineers bring to organizations and society. We hope this will inspire 
you to consider a rewarding career in this field.

## Getting Started 🏁

### Prerequisites 👓
- A workstation, can be your own laptop, or a laptop provided by us. 
- Access to the internet, our team will provide you with guest WiFi details if you're on-site.

### Setup 🛠️
1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) (Or log in to your existing account)
2. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/u-ways/kotlin-quarkus-realworld-example-app/fork) to have your own copy of the project.
   - Keep the forked repository public, so that our team can access it and so you can show it off to your friends and family!
   - If you want to learn about forking in detail, [read this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
3. We are going to use the Kotlin Playground to write and run our code as our cloud-based IDE. 
   - [Click here to open the Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/#eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoiMS45LjAiLCJwbGF0Zm9ybSI6ImphdmEiLCJhcmdzIjoiIiwibm9uZU1hcmtlcnMiOnRydWUsInRoZW1lIjoiaWRlYSIsImNvZGUiOiJmdW4gbWFpbigpIHtcbiAgICB2YWwga290bGluID0gXCLwn5mCXCJcbiAgICBwcmludGxuKGtvdGxpbilcbn0ifQ==).
